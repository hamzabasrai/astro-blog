In my last post I talked about what I wanted to build with Astro. Now, I want to share why I chose Astro to build my projects.

Both the projects I'm interested in building are content-driven and not heavily interactive. I think a server-rendered site is perfect for this use case and Astro fits the bill. I also get the benefit of being able to use my existing React knowledge to build the websites since Astro can support multiple frontend frameworks.
